# Eli Bre

[View the live project here.](https://marianneuk.github.io/EliBreMusic/)

My friend Eliane Brechbühl is a talented singer/songwriter, originally from Switzerland. Our paths crossed in Cambridge, UK and immediately found common grounds. When I let her know of my upcoming project, she told me that she did not have a website yet, despite her strong social media presence. Eli has beautiful pictures and lots of great content, which I thought would make a fantastic website where she could showcase all of her work on one dedicated platform.

<!--- Elibremusic.com is the official website for the independent singer/songwriter Eli Bre. Eli Bre already has a strong social media presence, and the website aims to promote the artist and her music, increase her fan base as well as offering a professional platform where she can showcase her work and sell music and book gigs. --->

# 1. User Experience (UX) development process
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

According to Jesse James Garrett, the user experience development process is all about ensuring that no aspect of the user’s experience with your site happens without your conscious, explicit intent. This means taking into account every possibility of every action the user is likely to take and understanding the user’s expectations at every step of the way through that process.

According to [WebFX](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/wireframing-benefits/), wireframes give web developers a clear path of what has to be done. It clarifies the direction and objectives of the site build and allows for better decision-making as to which web technologies, techniques and processes should be used in order to achieve an excellent result.

For this project, wireframes were created using Adobe XD. All wireframes were shown to the client for approval, prior to starting the website development.

- A mailing list sign–up – a mailing list sign-up form on the main page of the website so readers can’t miss it. Email is the most direct and effective way to contact fans, so it should be made easy and appealing to join the mailing list.
- A music and merch store – selling merchandise directly from the website will make the artist look professional and serious about their music career. The artist can keep a higher cut of the royalties this way, too.
